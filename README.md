# Basic Programs

<br/>

## Q 1. Check the given number is **_EVEN or ODD_**.

```js
function checkEvenOrOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return "Even";
  } else {
    return "Odd";
  }
}
//Example usage:
console.log(checkEvenOrOdd(4)); // Output: Even
console.log(checkEvenOrOdd(7)); // Output: Odd
```

<br/>

## Q 2. Check the given number is **_EVEN or ODD_**.

```js
function calculateFactorial(number) {
  if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    let factorial = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= number; i++) {
      factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorial;
  }
}
//Example usage:
console.log(calculateFactorial(5)); // Output: 120
console.log(calculateFactorial(0)); // Output: 1
```

In the above program, the calculateFactorial function takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial.
If the number is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.
Otherwise, a for loop is used to iterate from 2 to the given number, multiplying each number to the factorial variable.
The final factorial value is returned.

You can test the program by calling the calculateFactorial function with different numbers.
In the example above, it is called with 5 and 0, and it returns the factorial values of 120 and 1, respectively.

<br/>

## Q 3. Find the **_Factorial_** of a number using **_Recursion_** .

```js
function calculateFactorialRecursive(number) {
  if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return number * calculateFactorialRecursive(number - 1);
  }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(calculateFactorialRecursive(5)); // Output: 120
console.log(calculateFactorialRecursive(0)); // Output: 1

/*
 Factorial Using Recursion

 In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n,
 denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers
 less than or equal to n:

  n! can be written as
  n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) * n;

  n! can also be written as
  n! = n * (n-1)!
  This approach helps to calculate using Recursion

  5! = 5 * 4!
  4! = 4 * 3!
  3! = 3 * 2!
  2! = 2 * 1!
  1! = 1

 */
```

<br/>

## Q 4. **_Swap two numbers_** without using third variable.

```js
function swapNumbers(a, b) {
  a = a + b;
  b = a - b;
  a = a - b;
  return [a, b];
}

// Example usage:
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
console.log("Before swapping: x =", x, "and y =", y);
[x, y] = swapNumbers(x, y);
console.log("After swapping: x =", x, "and y =", y);
```

In the above function, the swapNumbers function takes two numbers a and b as arguments.
The swapping is done using arithmetic operations without using a third variable.

We first assign a + b to a. This step stores the sum of the two numbers in a.
We then assign a - b to b. This step stores the original value of a in b.
Finally, we assign a - b to a. This step stores the original value of b in a.
After calling the swapNumbers function, the values of x and y will be swapped.
In the example above, the initial values are x = 10 and y = 5. After swapping,
the values become x = 5 and y = 10.

<br/>

## Q 5. How to check the given number is **_Positive or Negative_** in JavaScript?

```js
function checkPositiveNegative(number) {
  if (number > 0) {
    return "Positive";
  } else if (number < 0) {
    return "Negative";
  } else {
    return "Zero";
  }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(checkPositiveNegative(5)); // Output: Positive
console.log(checkPositiveNegative(-7)); // Output: Negative
console.log(checkPositiveNegative(0)); // Output: Zero
```

In the checkPositiveNegative function, the number is compared to 0 using the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators.
If the number is greater than 0, it is considered positive. If the number is less than 0, it is considered negative.
If the number is equal to 0, it is considered zero. The corresponding string is returned based on the comparison result.

You can call the checkPositiveNegative function with different numbers to test whether they are positive, negative, or zero.
In the example above, it is called with the numbers 5, -7, and 0, and it returns the corresponding results.
